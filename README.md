<h2>Description</h2>
I was tasked with researching an exploit and designing a presentation to educate others. Stormbreaker is a very powerful social engineering tool. It allows a bad actor to target a vulnerable user through many various means, Phishing being the most used vector. Stormbreaker utilizes the use of secure tunnel to communicate between the actor and the target. Allowing any sensitive information obtained to be delivered without the user being aware.This slideshow will demonstrate Stormbreaker's utilization and implentation.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Linux</b>
- <b>Ngrok</b>


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>
- <b>iOS</b>
- <b>iPadOS</b>

<h2>Project Slideshow:</h2>  

- [Stormbreaker Project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cElRMgJ7sg5T49vrhCHG0vE0jS5EcOxqv3A4fbBTUns/edit?usp=sharing)

<br />

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>  

Social engineering is easily the most communicative way of delivering malicious exploits. As we are increasingly connected through many devices the average user must stay educated in Cyber Defense to avoid their sensitive information from being compromised.
